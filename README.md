# portfo
This repository contains all of the contents of my porfolio. It is written using python, html, css, and javascript. I also use the flask application to function as the server. My portfolio is deployed at this location: juli3.pythonanywhere.com

The flask application requires that the html files are stored in a "template" folder and all of the other files (.css, js, images, etc.)  are stored in a "static" folder. The server.py file implements the flask app.
